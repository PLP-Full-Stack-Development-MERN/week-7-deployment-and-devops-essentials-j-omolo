# Personal Blog Platform

## Project Overview
The Personal Blog Platform is a MERN stack application that allows users to create, edit, and publish blog posts. This project focuses on implementing DevOps practices, including version control, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud hosting, while ensuring application reliability through monitoring and logging.

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-blog-platform.git
   cd mern-blog-platform
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file and add your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string).

3. Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

## Deployment
### Backend Deployment
- Deploy the backend using Render:
  - Push your code to the Render platform.
  - Configure environment variables securely in the Render dashboard.
  - Use PM2 for process management.

### Frontend Deployment
- Deploy the frontend on Vercel:
  - Connect the frontend to the deployed backend API.
  - Ensure responsiveness and performance optimization.

## CI/CD Pipeline
- The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
  - Automated tests run on every push.
  - Notifications are sent to contributors for failed builds.
  - The CI configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Integrated logging tool (e.g., Winston or Morgan) for tracking requests.
- Sentry is used for frontend error tracking.
- Monitor server logs using Render's dashboard.

## Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Store sensitive credentials using environment variables.
- Implement basic authentication for accessing the admin panel.

## Conclusion
This Personal Blog Platform project serves as a practical example of applying DevOps practices in a MERN stack application. Follow the instructions above to set up, deploy, and maintain the application effectively.
